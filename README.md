# afk

This is a self-running inactive bot for 24/7 Minecraft server hosted by Aternos.

### GUIDE

To run this service, update the server information in file `config.json`.

Then, open the **Terminal**, type **`npm install`** (make sure you installed NodeJS 16+).

Finally, type **`node index.js`** to execute.

> WARNING: The bot will automatically turn off if you shutdown the computer. 
> So in order to perform 24/7, I recommend deploy it on [replit]() or a paid VPS service for the best experiences.
